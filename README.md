# Importance of Image Classification


- **Image classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision, used in various real-world applications like medical imaging, facial recognition, and object detection.**
- **Accurate classification helps automate decision-making processes, improve efficiency, and reduce human error.**

- **Manual Image Sorting: Manually identifying and sorting images into categories (cats and dogs) is time-consuming and prone to mistakes.**
- **Automation Sorting : There is a need for an automated solution that can quickly and accurately classify large volumes of images.**
